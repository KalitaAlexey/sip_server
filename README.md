SIP server or testing tool written in Rust.

Features:
* Passwordless registration
* Subscriptions (200 OK and NOTIFY without content)
* Regular calls (B2BUA and Proxy):
    * INVITE (call, hold, resume)
    * CANCEL
    * BYE

The server works via UDP only. TCP will be done in few next days

Suggestions are really appreciated.
